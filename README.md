# ðŸª§ Solari Board Display (Pygame)

## ðŸš€ Project Status: Retired

Iâ€™ve decided to retire this project. While there are many ways it could be expanded, Iâ€™m happy with what Iâ€™ve achieved so far.  
Due to personal circumstances, I wonâ€™t be actively developing or maintaining it further.

## ðŸŽ¯ About the Project

This project was designed to mimic a **Solari split-flap display** using **Pygame**.  
The original vision was to build a **boxed monitor** version â€” powered by a **Raspberry Pi**, with a **screen**, **speakers**, and some **carpentry work** to recreate the tactile feel, look, and sound of a real Solari board.

Although I didnâ€™t take it to the hardware stage, the digital version works beautifully on a large 27-inch monitor and captures the essence of that retro mechanical charm.
